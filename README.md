### Access
*NOTE:* Insert link to deployed page here.

### HTML Structuring
The Horiseon page makes use of section tags to assist screen readers in locating and grouping relevant content. Additionally, every image has a descriptive alt attribute to help Horiseon users envision our goals and how we aim to achieve them. Furthermore, several other specific HTML tags, such as header, footer, nav, etc., are utilized to help screen readers recognize what the most important content is on the page and help our users access it as quickly as possible.

### CSS Styling and Structure
Horiseon's stylesheet consolidates repeated styling blocks to reduce superfluous lines of code and facilitate faster code changes for all like-themed elements. 

### Future Updates Roadmap
* Add a "Skip to Main Content" feature for accessibility
